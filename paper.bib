  abstract="Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) is an interesting means to make computing systems resilient in presence of failures and attacks. That being said, designing and implementing BFT protocols is a hard and tedious task. This first comes from the inherent complexity of designing BFT distributed protocols, reasoning about their correctness, and implementing the software prototype of the protocols in a consistent and efficient way. Another reason that makes BFT protocols hard and error prone is the lack of tools for testing and evaluating protocols implementations in various and realistic settings. Furthermore, BFT protocols differ in many aspects, ranging from the faulty behaviors they handle, to the communication patterns and cryptographic mechanisms they apply. Thus, a comprehensive benchmarking environment is still missing to easily analyze and compare the effectiveness and performance of these protocols. In this paper, we present BFT-Bench, the first benchmarking framework for evaluating and comparing BFT protocols in practice. BFT-Bench includes different BFT protocols implementations, their automatic deployment in a distributed setting, the ability to define and inject different faulty behaviors and workloads, and the online monitoring and reporting of performance and dependability measures. The experimental results of the evaluation of BFT-Bench show the effectiveness of the framework, easily allowing an empirical comparison of different BFT protocols, in various workload and fault scenarios.",

Signature size in a `typical' system might range from a few hundred bytes to a few kilobytes, and generation of a signature might require a few hundred to a few thousand computations of the underlying conventional encryption function.",

EPaxos achieves three goals: (1) optimal commit latency in the wide-area when tolerating one and two failures, under realistic conditions; (2) uniform load balancing across all replicas (thus achieving high throughput); and (3) graceful performance degradation when replicas are slow or crash.Egalitarian Paxos is to our knowledge the first protocol to achieve the previously stated goals efficiently---that is, requiring only a simple majority of replicas to be non-faulty, using a number of messages linear in the number of replicas to choose a command, and committing commands after just one communication round (one round trip) in the common case or after at most two rounds in any case. We prove Egalitarian Paxos's properties theoretically and demonstrate its advantages empirically through an implementation running on Amazon EC2.},

  abstract = {It is proved that any algebraic-geometric (AG) code can be expressed as a cross section of an extended multidimensional cyclic code. Both AG codes and multidimensional cyclic codes are described by a unified theory of linear block codes defined over point sets: AG codes are defined over the points of an algebraic curve, and an m-dimensional cyclic code is defined over the points in m-dimensional space. The power of the unified theory is in its description of decoding techniques using Grobner bases. In order to fit an AG code into this theory, a change of coordinates must be applied to the curve over which the code is defined so that the curve is in special position. For curves in special position, all computations can be performed with polynomials and this also makes it possible to use the theory of Grobner bases. Next, a transform is defined for AG codes which generalizes the discrete Fourier transform. The transform is also related to a Grobner basis, and is useful in setting up the decoding problem. In the decoding problem, a key step is finding a Grobner basis for an error locator ideal. For AG codes, multidimensional cyclic codes, and indeed, any cross section of an extended multidimensional cyclic code, Sakata's algorithm can be used to find linear recursion relations which hold on the syndrome array. In this general context, the authors give a self-contained and simplified presentation of Sakata's algorithm, and present a general framework for decoding algorithms for this family of codes, in which the use of Sakata's algorithm is supplemented by a procedure for extending the syndrome array},

abstract = {A longstanding vision in distributed systems is to build reliable systems from unreliable components. An enticing formulation of this vision is Byzantine Fault-Tolerant (BFT) state machine replication, in which a group of servers collectively act as a correct server even if some of the servers misbehave or malfunction in arbitrary (“Byzantine”) ways. Despite this promise, practitioners hesitate to deploy BFT systems, at least partly because of the perception that BFT must impose high overheads.In this article, we present Zyzzyva, a protocol that uses speculation to reduce the cost of BFT replication. In Zyzzyva, replicas reply to a client's request without first running an expensive three-phase commit protocol to agree on the order to process requests. Instead, they optimistically adopt the order proposed by a primary server, process the request, and reply immediately to the client. If the primary is faulty, replicas can become temporarily inconsistent with one another, but clients detect inconsistencies, help correct replicas converge on a single total ordering of requests, and only rely on responses that are consistent with this total order. This approach allows Zyzzyva to reduce replication overheads to near their theoretical minima and to achieve throughputs of tens of thousands of requests per second, making BFT replication practical for a broad range of demanding services.},
